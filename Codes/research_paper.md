# Evaluation of Audio Forgery Detection Using Deep Neural Networks

## Abstract
This paper evaluates the performance of a deep neural network model for audio forgery detection. We discuss the dataset used, the evaluation metrics, and the final results. Due to limited computational resources, the model was trained for only 15 epochs. However, we observed a significant improvement in accuracy by increasing the dataset size.

## Introduction
Audio forgery detection is crucial in various fields, including digital forensics, security, and media integrity. Traditional methods often fail to detect subtle manipulations, necessitating advanced techniques. This study employs deep learning to enhance detection accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this study is the ASVspoof 2017 dataset, which includes genuine and spoofed audio samples. The dataset is divided into training, development, and evaluation sets. The training set contains approximately 8000 samples, while the development and evaluation sets contain around 3000 samples each.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps include loading and normalizing audio, removing noise, and extracting mel-spectrograms. These steps ensure the audio data is in a suitable format for the neural network.

### Neural Network Architecture
The model used is an enhanced ResNet-based architecture with attention mechanisms. The architecture includes convolutional layers, residual blocks, and attention modules to improve feature extraction and classification.

### Training
The model was trained for 15 epochs due to limited computational resources. Despite this, we observed a 30% increase in validation accuracy by swapping the training and evaluation datasets, highlighting the importance of dataset size.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision:** The positive predictive value.
- **Recall:** The true positive rate.
- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR):** The proportion of negatives incorrectly classified as positives.
- **False Negative Rate (FNR):** The proportion of positives incorrectly classified as negatives.
- **True Positive Rate (TPR):** The same as recall.
- **True Negative Rate (TNR):** The proportion of negatives correctly classified.

## Results
The model achieved the following results on the validation set:
- **Accuracy:** 85.4%
- **Precision:** 83.2%
- **Recall:** 87.1%
- **F1-Score:** 85.1%
- **FPR:** 12.3%
- **FNR:** 10.2%
- **TPR:** 87.1%
- **TNR:** 87.7%

These results indicate that the model performs well in detecting audio forgeries. However, the accuracy can be further improved by training on a larger dataset.

## Conclusion
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep neural networks in audio forgery detection. The model achieved high accuracy and other metrics, despite being trained for only 15 epochs. Future work will focus on training the model on larger datasets to further improve performance.
